 Semantic Search Engine using Dense Retrieval

This project implements a semantic search system using dense embeddings and FAISS on the MS MARCO dataset as part of the IEEE Machine Learning Team Induction Task – Round 2.

Features
- Dense semantic retrieval using Sentence Transformers
- FAISS-based efficient nearest neighbor search
- Evaluation using Recall@K
- Hybrid retrieval using BM25 + Dense embeddings (Bonus)
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (Bonus)
- Two-stage retrieval with cross-encoder re-ranking (Bonus)
 Dataset
- MS MARCO Passage Ranking Dataset
- Subset of 100,000 passages used for experimentation

 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload MS MARCO dataset files to Google Drive
3. Run all cells sequentially
